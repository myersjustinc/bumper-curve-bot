        <strong>bumperbot</strong> allows users to refer to
        <a href="https://www.who.int/toolkits/child-growth-standards"><abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> growth standards</a>
        without leaving Discord.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bot provides a
        <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ">slash command</a>,
        <code>/curve</code>, that checks the given weight, length or
        head circumference against the WHO curves we all probably watch a bit
        too closely already.

          A sequence of screenshots of Discord on mobile. The user is shown
          typing `/curve weight` and being prompted for a child's sex, weight
          and age. After filling those out, the bot replies: 'At 9 weeks, a
          girl weighing 13 lb 2 oz is at the 85.8th percentile.' The user then
          types `/curve length` and is prompted similarly; the bot then
          replies, 'At 8 weeks, 5 days, a boy 2 ft 1 in long is at the 99.4th
          percentile.'
