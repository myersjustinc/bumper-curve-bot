        This service is intended for use solely through the Discord platform
        and rejects queries submitted from elsewhere. By using this service,
        you agree not to attempt to subject it to excessive load or extract
        Discord access credentials of any type.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, this service does not keep any record of the users or
        Discord servers that interact with it. If the service allows you to
        keep a record of any of your information, and you make use of that
        optional functionality, you do so at your own risk. If you believe you
        believe you have stored information with this service and wish to
        inspect it or remove it, please contact
        <a href="mailto:bots@journalism.ninja">bots@journalism.ninja</a>.
